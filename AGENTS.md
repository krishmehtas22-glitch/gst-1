# Invoice batch contract

The user explicitly requires complete XML batches for review in Tally.

- All future Cerebras, Gemini, Groq, or other AI batch integrations must use the complete
  batch workflow (`read_with_fallback`, then `process_sources` with the saved
  client batch policy). Never let API quota expiry discard successful reads.
- Switch to other configured providers (Cerebras, Groq, Gemini) for remaining sources; use local
  Python/OCR when configured APIs cannot finish. Do not enable billing, add
  paid providers, or request secrets in chat.
- Produce one XML voucher element per scanned invoice, including incomplete
  ones. Keep uncertainties in narration and Batch_Report.json rather than
  blocking XML for GSTIN, seller, unit/master, or reconciliation issues.
- Use accounting vouchers when inventory cannot be reconstructed. Preserve
  printed GST components and amounts; record any explicit unresolved values,
  placeholders or difference ledger postings. Do not claim fabricated fields
  are extracted facts or AI batch acceptance is individual human approval.
- AI may infer missing selling units from product/packaging context. Retain
  the reason, mark the unit assumed, and include it in narration/report.
  Printed units and human corrections outrank assumptions. Qty is a heading,
  not a selling unit. Never scale quantities/rates or confuse medicine strength
  with sold weight/volume. Retain explicit custom printed units.
- Keep separate clients and sellers isolated. Fresh output paths must contain
  one consolidated Masters.xml and Sales_Vouchers.xml per seller, with an exact
  input/output count. Open client XML folder must show this latest run.
- Apply shared `ai_invoice_rules.RULES` to every provider prompt. Resolve Buyer/
  Bill To separately from Supplier/Seller, Ship To, bank and signatory. Preserve
  the buyer name and exact buyer ledger in the report. Every referenced buyer,
  sales, tax and difference ledger must have a matching exported master.
- Preserve prior financial/import history and manual corrections. Keep stable
  voucher GUIDs and do not force-release another live process's OS lock.
- XML generation is not proof of successful Tally import or correct GSTR-1.
  Test partial-provider exhaustion, all-local fallback, master-unit variants,
  missing fields, zero GST, updated output paths, and unchanged retained history.
